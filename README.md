## Gameplay:

Welcome to the ball game!

Your mission is to navigate your ball strategically to defeat the stationary enemy. Master the controls to adjust direction, rotation, and execute jumps to defeat your enemy in a more fantasy way. When starting the game, your adversary remains motionless, providing you with an opportunity to plan your moves. Choose the level of challenge that suits you by pressing the corresponding number key.

## End of Game:

The game concludes when the ball falls from the platform. At this point, the results of your game will be displayed in a new window. The results may include your score. A new game will restart automatically after falling down for a few seconds.

### Known Issues:

After the results window closes, the mouse focus may not automatically return to the game window. To resume playing, simply click the mouse once within the game window. In addition, if you have any suggestions to enhance the visual appeal of the window, I would greatly appreciate hearing them.

## Tips:

* Experiment with the controls to get comfortable with the ball's movement and rotation.
* Timing is crucial, especially when performing jumps and double jumps.
* Pay attention to the environment and adapt your strategy to overcome different challenges.
